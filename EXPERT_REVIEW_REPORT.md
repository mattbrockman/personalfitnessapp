## 1. Dr. Peter Attia - Longevity & Healthspan Focus

*"The goal isn't to live longer—it's to live better, longer. Exercise is the most powerful longevity drug we have."*

### Overall Impression: B+

FORGE shows promising architecture for the serious trainee, but misses some critical longevity-focused metrics that I consider essential for optimizing the Marginal Decade.

---

### Positive Feedback

#### Zone 2 Training Infrastructure
**Rating: A-**

I'm genuinely impressed that this app has proper zone-based training built into its core. The 7-zone model with explicit Z2 tracking is exactly what I prescribe for metabolic health. The fact that cardio structures can specify "steady state" workouts with Z2 intensity shows the developers understand that most people need MORE easy aerobic work, not less.

The TSS (Training Stress Score) tracking and zone distribution per workout allows users to ensure they're spending adequate time in that critical fat-oxidation zone. This is foundational for mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic flexibility.

#### Strength Training Emphasis
**Rating: A**

The exercise database with 2,000+ movements and proper progressive overload tracking through 1RM estimation (Brzycki formula) is solid. I constantly emphasize that strength is perhaps the most underrated longevity intervention. The fact that this app treats strength training as a first-class citizen alongside cardio—not an afterthought—aligns with my philosophy.

The set tracking with RPE logging allows for proper auto-regulation, which becomes increasingly important as we age.

#### Sleep & Recovery Integration
**Rating: B+**

Sleep is the foundation. I appreciate that:
- HRV tracking is included
- Sleep stages are captured (deep sleep is crucial)
- Recovery scores influence AI workout suggestions
- Eight Sleep integration is planned

This holistic approach recognizes that training adaptation happens during recovery, not during the workout itself.

#### Multi-Sport Balance Rules
**Rating: A-**

The ability to set rules like "reduce cycling 30% during strength building phases" shows sophisticated understanding of interference effects. Concurrent training requires careful management, and this feature allows for intelligent periodization across modalities.

---

### Critical Gaps & Concerns

#### Missing: VO2max Tracking & Estimation
**Rating: F (Critical Omission)**

This is my biggest concern. VO2max is the single strongest predictor of all-cause mortality—stronger than smoking, hypertension, or diabetes. A 1 MET increase in cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with a 10-25% reduction in mortality.

**Recommendation:** Add VO2max estimation from:
- Strava fitness (relative effort trends)
- Heart rate during standard efforts
- Cooper test or other field tests
- Direct integration with devices that estimate it

Users should see their estimated VO2max prominently displayed and track it over time. Set targets based on age-adjusted percentiles.

#### Missing: Stability & Balance Work
**Rating: D**

I talk extensively about the four pillars: Stability, Strength, Aerobic Efficiency, Anaerobic Performance. This app has three of four but completely lacks stability programming.

**Recommendation:** Add:
- Mobility/stability workout category
- DNS (Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization) exercises
- Single-leg balance assessments
- Hip hinge and rotational stability work
- Integration with physical therapy exercises

Falls are a leading cause of death in the elderly. Training stability NOW prevents catastrophic events later.

#### Missing: Glucose & Metabolic Markers
**Rating: C**

For true longevity optimization, I want to see:
- CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor) data integration
- Fasting glucose trends
- Post-meal glucose spikes correlated with meals logged
- HOMA-IR estimation capabilities

The nutrition tracking exists but doesn't connect to metabolic outcomes.

**Recommendation:** Add CGM integration (Levels, Dexcom) and visualize glucose response to different foods and workout timing.

#### Missing: Grip Strength Tracking
**Rating: D**

Grip strength is a powerful biomarker for all-cause mortality and cognitive decline. It's easy to measure and track.

**Recommendation:** Add grip strength logging with periodic testing reminders (monthly). Show trends and percentile rankings.

#### Missing: Body Composition Details
**Rating: C+**

Weight and body fat percentage are tracked, but I'd want:
- DEXA scan integration or manual entry
- Lean mass trends (more important than weight)
- Visceral fat estimates
- Appendicular lean mass index (ALMI)

**Recommendation:** Add detailed body composition fields and track lean mass preservation, especially important during fat loss phases.

---

### Specific Suggestions

1. **Add a "Centenarian Decathlon" Goal Type**
   - Let users define 10 physical tasks they want to perform at age 100
   - Reverse-engineer training requirements
   - Track progress toward those capabilities

2. **Implement Minimum Effective Dose Indicators**
   - Show when users hit longevity thresholds (150 min/week moderate, 3x strength)
   - Distinguish between "minimum for health" and "optimal for performance"

3. **Add Medication/Supplement Tracking**
   - Many longevity-focused individuals track supplements
   - Correlate with performance metrics

4. **Create "Decade View" for Long-Term Trends**
   - Most apps show weeks or months
   - Longevity requires thinking in decades
   - Show projected trajectories

5. **Add Resting Heart Rate Trends**
   - Already tracking sleep HR
   - Display RHR trends prominently (strong longevity signal)

---

### Summary from Peter Attia's Perspective

FORGE has excellent bones for a training app—the periodization, zone-based cardio, and strength tracking are genuinely sophisticated. However, for true longevity optimization, it needs to expand beyond "fitness" into "healthspan."

The missing VO2max tracking is inexcusable for any serious health-focused platform. Adding stability work, metabolic markers, and grip strength would transform this from a good training app into a genuine longevity tool.

**Grade: B+**
**Would I recommend to patients?** Yes, for the training component, but they'd need to supplement with other tools for complete longevity tracking.

## 2. Dr. Stephen Seiler - Endurance Training Science

*"The pyramidal or polarized intensity distribution isn't just for elites—it's how the body best adapts to endurance training."*

### Overall Impression: B+

FORGE shows commendable understanding of endurance training principles, but could better implement the polarized training model that decades of research supports.

---

### Positive Feedback

#### Zone Distribution Tracking
**Rating: A**

Finally, an app that properly tracks TIME IN ZONE, not just average heart rate. The zone distribution data structure capturing seconds spent in each zone is exactly what's needed to verify training intensity distribution.

The research is clear: successful endurance athletes spend 75-80% of training time in Zone 1-2 and only 15-20% at high intensity. This app has the infrastructure to track this crucial metric.

#### TSS & Training Load Concepts
**Rating: B+**

The inclusion of TSS (Training Stress Score) and the CTL/ATL/TSB (Chronic Training Load, Acute Training Load, Training Stress Balance) framework shows the developers understand periodization. These concepts, derived from Banister's impulse-response model, are scientifically validated.

I'm pleased to see:
- Planned vs actual TSS tracking
- Weekly TSS targets
- Compliance calculations

#### Interval Workout Specification
**Rating: A-**

The cardio structure allowing for complex intervals is well-designed:
- Warmup/main set/cooldown separation
- Repeatable interval blocks
- Intensity specification per interval
- Duration flexibility

This allows prescription of classic sessions like 4x8 minute threshold intervals or 30/30s VO2max work.

#### Week Type Classification
**Rating: A**

The recognition of different week types (normal, build, recovery, deload, test, race) shows proper mesocycle thinking. Recovery weeks are NOT optional—they're when adaptation occurs. Too many apps treat all weeks identically.

---

### Critical Gaps & Concerns

#### Missing: Explicit Polarized Distribution Targets
**Rating: C**

While the app CAN track zone distribution, it doesn't PRESCRIBE or TARGET a distribution. This is a missed opportunity.

**Recommendation:**
- Add polarized training mode that targets 80/0/20 (Zone 1-2 / Zone 3 / Zone 4-5)
- Show weekly intensity distribution visually (pie chart or bar)
- Alert users when they're accumulating too much "gray zone" (Zone 3) work
- Display rolling 4-week intensity distribution

The single biggest mistake recreational endurance athletes make is too much moderate intensity and not enough truly easy or truly hard work.

#### Missing: Session RPE & Training Monotony
**Rating: C**

I've published extensively on session RPE (rating the entire workout, not just individual sets). Combined with training load, this allows calculation of:
- Training monotony (SD of daily loads)
- Training strain (load × monotony)
- Injury risk prediction

**Recommendation:** Add post-workout session RPE (1-10 scale) and calculate monotony/strain metrics. Alert when strain gets dangerously high.

#### Missing: Talk Test / Ventilatory Threshold Guidance
**Rating: C+**

Zone 2 is often defined by lactate threshold, but recreational athletes rarely have lab testing. The talk test (can you hold a conversation?) is a valid, accessible alternative.

**Recommendation:** Add guidance for determining zones without lab testing. Include talk test instructions and perceived exertion correlates.

#### Strava Integration Limitations
**Rating: B-**

Strava integration is good but doesn't pull:
- Strava's Relative Effort (their TSS equivalent)
- Fitness/Freshness (their CTL/ATL)
- Suffer Score

This means users tracking on Strava and FORGE have fragmented data.

**Recommendation:** Import Strava's training load metrics to create unified view.

#### Missing: Long-Term Aerobic Development Indicators
**Rating: C**

For endurance athletes, I want to see:
- Aerobic decoupling (HR drift vs power/pace drift)
- Efficiency factor (normalized power / average HR)
- Pace/power at fixed HR over time
- Threshold progression

These metrics show whether the aerobic base is actually improving.

**Recommendation:** Calculate and display decoupling percentage for steady-state efforts. Track efficiency factor trends.

---

### Specific Suggestions

1. **Add "Polarized Training" Plan Template**
   - Default to 80% low intensity, 20% high intensity
   - Explicitly minimize Zone 3 prescription
   - Show weekly compliance with target distribution

2. **Implement "Session Load" Calculation**
   - Session RPE × Duration
   - More practical than TSS for most athletes
   - Better predictor of adaptation and injury

3. **Add Block Periodization Option**
   - Concentrated loading blocks
   - 3-4 week focus periods
   - Especially relevant for time-crunched athletes

4. **Create "Threshold Progression" Chart**
   - Track FTP, LTHR, threshold pace over months
   - Most meaningful metric for endurance improvement
   - Auto-detect breakthroughs from workout data

5. **Add "Training History Summary" for Coaching**
   - Total hours per zone over 12 weeks
   - Average weekly volume
   - Intensity distribution percentage
   - Easy to share with coaches

6. **Implement "Freshness" Indicator**
   - TSB (Training Stress Balance) visualization
   - Target TSB ranges for different phases
   - Peaking calculator for races

---

### Concerns About AI Plan Generation

The AI-generated plans need validation against research-backed principles:

1. **Verify polarized distribution**: Does the AI naturally create 80/20 splits, or does it prescribe too much threshold work?

2. **Recovery timing**: Are recovery weeks properly placed every 3-4 weeks of building?

3. **Volume progression**: Is weekly volume increase kept to 3-5% (research-supported maximum)?

4. **Specificity timing**: Is race-specific intensity added closer to events?

**Recommendation:** Add validation checks on AI-generated plans to ensure they conform to evidence-based intensity distributions.

---

### Summary from Stephen Seiler's Perspective

FORGE has solid infrastructure for endurance training—zone tracking, TSS, interval specification are all properly implemented. The weakness is in guidance and visualization.

Athletes need to SEE their intensity distribution to manage it. They need explicit targets for the 80/20 (or 90/10 for high-volume athletes) split. The app captures data but doesn't leverage it for polarized training optimization.

**Grade: B+**
**Would I recommend?** Yes, for serious endurance athletes who understand periodization. Less useful for beginners who need more prescriptive guidance on intensity distribution.

## 3. Dr. Andy Galpin - Exercise Physiology & Adaptation

*"There are nine distinct adaptations to training, and your programming should target them specifically."*

### Overall Impression: B

FORGE has good training infrastructure but lacks the adaptation-specific thinking I advocate. It's built around workouts, not around the specific physiological responses we're trying to create.

---

### Positive Feedback

#### Comprehensive Exercise Database
**Rating: A**

2,000+ exercises with proper categorization (compound/isolation, equipment, muscle groups) is excellent. The inclusion of coaching cues and common mistakes shows attention to quality execution, not just volume.

#### Progressive Overload Tracking
**Rating: A-**

The 1RM estimation, volume tracking, and rep range organization allows for proper strength progression. The ability to track both target and actual weight/reps enables the fundamental progressive overload principle.

#### RPE Integration
**Rating: A**

RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) at the set level is crucial for auto-regulation. Not every day is a max effort day, and the body doesn't respond linearly to training stress. This feature allows smart athletes to modify in real-time.

#### Multi-Sport Periodization
**Rating: B+**

The balance rules and activity distribution features show understanding of concurrent training challenges. Interference effects between strength and endurance are real, and this app attempts to manage them.

---

### Critical Gaps & Concerns

#### Missing: Adaptation-Specific Goal Setting
**Rating: D**

I've identified nine distinct adaptations:
1. Skill/Technique
2. Speed/Power
3. Strength
4. Hypertrophy
5. Muscular Endurance
6. Anaerobic Capacity
7. VO2max/Aerobic Power
8. Long Duration Endurance
9. Body Composition

This app has "Strength, Endurance, Weight Loss, General Fitness, Event Prep" as goals. These are vague and don't map to physiological adaptations.

**Recommendation:** Allow users to prioritize specific adaptations and generate programming accordingly. A bodybuilder (hypertrophy), powerlifter (strength), and CrossFit athlete (multiple adaptations) need radically different programs even if all three say "strength training."

#### Missing: Training Phase Specificity for Adaptations
**Rating: C**

The periodization supports volume and intensity modifiers, but doesn't specify WHICH adaptation each phase targets.

**Recommendation:** Each phase should declare primary and secondary adaptations:
- "Base Phase: Primary = Long Duration Endurance, Secondary = Hypertrophy"
- "Strength Phase: Primary = Maximal Strength, Secondary = Power"

This drives exercise selection, rep ranges, rest periods, and tempo.

#### Missing: Speed & Power Training
**Rating: D**

The app handles strength and endurance well but has almost no infrastructure for:
- Plyometrics
- Olympic lifts (power output tracking)
- Sprint work
- Rate of force development
- Velocity-based training

**Recommendation:** Add:
- Power exercise category with intent specification
- Jump height/distance logging
- Sprint times
- Optional VBT (velocity-based training) integration
- Reactive strength index

#### Missing: Tempo/Time Under Tension Specification
**Rating: C**

For hypertrophy, eccentric tempo matters. For power, intent matters. The current set structure doesn't capture:
- Eccentric duration
- Concentric duration
- Pause durations
- Movement intent (maximal velocity vs controlled)

**Recommendation:** Add tempo field (e.g., 3-1-2-0 format) to exercise prescriptions. This is especially important for hypertrophy-focused training.

#### Missing: Fatigue Indicators Beyond Sleep
**Rating: C+**

Sleep and HRV are good, but I also track:
- Grip strength (daily or pre-workout)
- Vertical jump height
- Mood/motivation scores
- Subjective readiness

**Recommendation:** Add pre-workout readiness check:
- Quick subjective score (1-10)
- Optional grip test
- Optional jump test
- Compare to baseline for auto-regulation suggestions

#### Missing: Movement Quality / Technique Assessment
**Rating: D**

Skill is an adaptation. The app tracks what exercises were done but not how well. For longevity of training, movement quality matters enormously.

**Recommendation:** Add:
- Technique rating per exercise (1-5)
- Video storage for form review
- Notes field for technique observations
- "Movement screen" periodic assessments

---

### Specific Suggestions

1. **Implement "Adaptation-Based Programming"**
   - Select primary adaptation
   - Auto-generate appropriate rep ranges, rest periods, exercise types
   - For hypertrophy: 8-15 reps, 60-90s rest, high volume
   - For strength: 1-5 reps, 3-5min rest, moderate volume, high intensity
   - For power: 1-5 reps, full recovery, maximal intent

2. **Add "Training Age" Concept**
   - Novice/Intermediate/Advanced classification
   - Affects volume tolerance and progression rates
   - Novices progress weekly; advanced lifters monthly

3. **Create "Weekly Minimum Volumes by Muscle"**
   - Track sets per muscle group per week
   - Compare to MEV (Minimum Effective Volume) thresholds
   - Alert when falling below minimums or exceeding MRV (Maximum Recoverable Volume)

4. **Add "Deload Auto-Triggers"**
   - Performance regression over 2+ weeks
   - Excessive RPE inflation (same weight feels harder)
   - Sleep/recovery score decline
   - Don't just schedule deloads—trigger them when needed

5. **Implement "Strength Standards"**
   - Compare lifts to population percentiles
   - Wilks/DOTS/IPF GL scoring for powerlifters
   - Identify weaknesses relative to standards

6. **Add "Periodization Visualization"**
   - Show planned intensity/volume waves graphically
   - Visualize the entire macrocycle at once
   - Color-code by adaptation target

---

### Concerns About Current Implementation

1. **Rep Ranges Too Rigid**
   - "Reps_min" and "reps_max" suggest fixed targets
   - Real training should adjust based on daily readiness
   - Better: "Target 8-12 reps, adjust weight to hit RPE 7-8"

2. **Rest Periods Underemphasized**
   - Rest is specified but not enforced or tracked
   - Rest period compliance affects adaptation dramatically
   - Add rest timer with tracking

3. **No Superset Logic for Adaptation**
   - Supersets exist but aren't typed
   - Antagonist supersets (time efficient) differ from giant sets (metabolic stress)
   - Add superset intent specification

---

### Summary from Andy Galpin's Perspective

FORGE is a solid training logger that could become a great adaptation-targeting platform. The fundamental infrastructure is there—exercises, sets, reps, progressive tracking. What's missing is the physiological lens.

Athletes don't train to "do workouts"—they train to create specific adaptations. The app should ask "What are you trying to become?" and then generate programming that creates those adaptations through appropriate training stimuli.

**Grade: B**
**Would I recommend?** Yes, for self-coached intermediate athletes who understand their goals. The app tracks well but doesn't guide adaptation-specific programming.

<a name="greg-nuckols"></a>
## 4. Greg Nuckols - Evidence-Based Strength Training (Stronger By Science)

*"Most people just need to train hard, consistently, and progressively. Don't major in the minors."*

### Overall Impression: B+

FORGE is refreshingly practical for strength training. It focuses on the things that matter—progressive overload, volume tracking, exercise variety—without drowning users in unnecessary complexity.

---

### Positive Feedback

#### Estimated 1RM with Brzycki Formula
**Rating: A-**

Good choice. Brzycki is well-validated for rep ranges 1-10. The fact that you're estimating 1RM rather than requiring max testing is practical and safer for most trainees.

**Minor suggestion:** Consider offering multiple formulas (Epley, Lombardi) and averaging, or using rep-range-specific formulas. Brzycki tends to underestimate for very low reps and overestimate for higher reps.

#### Volume Tracking (Sets × Reps × Weight)
**Rating: A**

This is THE primary driver of hypertrophy and, to a degree, strength gains. Having this calculated automatically and displayable over time is exactly what's needed.

The research on volume is clear: more volume generally equals more gains (up to a point). Tracking this systematically prevents under-training and helps identify overreaching.

#### Rep Range Flexibility
**Rating: A-**

The "reps_min" and "reps_max" structure is practical. Not every set hits the same number—some sets you get 12, some you get 8. Recording the range rather than demanding exact numbers reflects real training.

#### Exercise Database Quality
**Rating: A**

2,000+ exercises with equipment tags, difficulty levels, and muscle targeting is comprehensive. The ability to filter by equipment prevents the frustrating experience of being prescribed exercises you can't do.

#### Set Type Differentiation
**Rating: A**

Distinguishing warmup, working, drop sets, and AMRAP is important:
- Warmup sets don't count toward volume
- AMRAP sets provide overload indication
- Drop sets affect fatigue differently

This granularity allows accurate volume and intensity tracking.

---

### Critical Gaps & Concerns

#### Missing: Relative Intensity (% of 1RM) Display
**Rating: C**

The app tracks absolute weights but doesn't show where that falls relative to estimated 1RM. This matters because:
- 80% 1RM for 3 sets of 8 is very different from 60% 1RM for 3 sets of 8
- Users should see "You lifted 225 lbs (75% of your estimated 1RM)"

**Recommendation:** Calculate and display relative intensity for each working set. Show average relative intensity for workouts.

#### Missing: Effective Reps / Stimulating Reps Concept
**Rating: C**

Recent research suggests that the most hypertrophically stimulating reps are those close to failure (approximately the last 5 reps of a set taken close to failure). A set of 15 at RPE 6 has fewer "effective reps" than a set of 8 at RPE 9.

**Recommendation:** Estimate effective reps based on RPE. A set at RPE 10 (failure) = reps performed are effective reps. At RPE 8, perhaps last 3-4 reps are effective. This gives a more accurate picture of growth stimulus.

#### Missing: Volume Landmarks Per Muscle
**Rating: B-**

The app tracks total volume but doesn't break it down by muscle group or compare to evidence-based landmarks:
- MEV (Minimum Effective Volume): ~6-8 sets/muscle/week for maintenance
- MAV (Maximum Adaptive Volume): 12-20 sets/muscle/week for most
- MRV (Maximum Recoverable Volume): Individual, typically 20-25+ sets

**Recommendation:** Calculate weekly sets per muscle group. Display alongside MEV/MAV/MRV ranges. Alert when persistently below MEV or approaching MRV.

#### Missing: Progression Model Specification
**Rating: C+**

The app tracks progress but doesn't prescribe HOW to progress. Evidence-based options include:
- Linear (add weight each session) - novices
- Double progression (add reps, then add weight) - intermediates
- Periodized (wave loading, block periodization) - advanced
- RPE-based progression

**Recommendation:** Let users select a progression model. Auto-suggest weight increases based on model and recent performance.

#### Missing: Frequency Optimization
**Rating: C**

Research shows that training a muscle 2x/week tends to outperform 1x/week for hypertrophy. The app doesn't analyze or optimize training frequency.

**Recommendation:** Calculate and display training frequency per muscle group. Flag muscles trained only 1x/week with suggestion to increase.

#### Missing: SFR (Stimulus to Fatigue Ratio) Considerations
**Rating: C**

Some exercises provide high stimulus with low systemic fatigue (leg press, machine work). Others provide high stimulus with high fatigue (deadlifts, barbell rows). This affects exercise selection, especially later in a session or week.

**Recommendation:** Tag exercises with relative fatigue ratings. Consider fatigue when auto-generating workouts or suggesting exercise swaps.

---

### Specific Suggestions

1. **Add "Practical 1RM Testing" Protocol**
   - Not everyone should max out
   - Provide 3RM or 5RM testing protocols
   - Calculate 1RM from submaximal
   - Track tested vs estimated 1RM

2. **Implement "Strength Progression" Recommendations**
   - If estimated 1RM stagnant for 3+ weeks, suggest programming change
   - If sets consistently above target reps, suggest weight increase
   - If RPE creeping up at same weight, suggest deload

3. **Create "Weak Point Analysis"**
   - Compare muscle group volumes
   - Compare lift ratios (bench vs row, squat vs deadlift)
   - Identify lagging areas for prioritization

4. **Add "Rep Quality Indicators"**
   - Distinguish full ROM vs partial reps
   - Note pauses, tempos, or technique modifications
   - Affects interpretation of volume

5. **Implement "Periodization Templates"**
   - Linear progression (novice default)
   - 5/3/1 structure
   - GZCL methodology
   - Block periodization
   - Let users select or the AI generate using these proven structures

6. **Add "Hypertrophy vs Strength" Mode**
   - Same exercises, different rep ranges and rest periods
   - Hypertrophy: 8-15 reps, shorter rest, higher volume
   - Strength: 3-6 reps, longer rest, higher intensity
   - Clear visualization of current mode

7. **Create "Simplified Volume Tracking"**
   - Hard sets per muscle per week (the metric that matters most)
   - Don't count warmups or very light sets
   - Compare to recommended ranges

---

### What FORGE Gets Right

1. **Not overcomplicating things**: The core loop of "log exercises, track weight, see progress" is exactly what most people need.

2. **Equipment filtering**: Hugely practical. Nothing worse than being told to do cable flyes when you train in a garage.

3. **RPE without requirement**: RPE is available but not mandatory. Some people hate logging RPE; forcing it causes compliance issues.

4. **Superset support**: Supersets are time-efficient and the app supports them properly.

5. **Set-by-set tracking**: More granular than needed for some, but allows detailed analysis for those who want it.

---

### Summary from Greg Nuckols' Perspective

FORGE gets the fundamentals right: track your lifts, progressive overload, volume accumulation. For 90% of trainees, this is sufficient to make excellent progress.

The gaps are mostly in the "optimization" category—relative intensity display, volume landmarks, progression model guidance. These matter more for intermediate/advanced lifters who have exhausted linear gains.

I'd use this app. I'd recommend it to readers. It doesn't try to do too much, and it does the important things well.

**Grade: B+**
**Would I recommend?** Absolutely. It handles strength training logging better than most dedicated lifting apps, plus it has cardio and nutrition. The all-in-one approach is valuable.
